{"name":"Casimir","body":"Cas.im/ir is inspired by — and tries to find its way between — both [lilURL](http://lilurl.sourceforge.net/) and [xav.cc](http://xav.cc/) 's [sfShortUrlPlugin](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfShortUrlPlugin), the first lacking some essential features and the later needing a whole [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/) environment, as the location implies.\r\n\r\nCas.im/ir is both available online at [cas.im](http://cas.im/) and as a [download](https://github.com/nhoizey/casimir/downloads) for self hosting.\r\n\r\nIt only needs PHP and MySQL to run. Just install it, following the instructions in the readme file, and enjoy it!\r\n\r\nThe development is [hosted on GitHub](http://github.com/nhoizey/flickrSuggest), so you can fork it and help me enhance it at will!\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer:* I didn't try to follow any PHP golden development rules, it just had to work as I needed.\r\n\r\nFollow [Cas.im/ir on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cas_im) to be notified of new releases or ask for help.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Database creation\r\n\r\nCreate these tables in your MySQL database:\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE `casimir` (\r\n      `short_url` varchar(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',\r\n      `long_url` text NOT NULL,\r\n      `creation_date` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',\r\n      `last_use_date` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',\r\n      `uses` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (`short_url`)\r\n    ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\r\n  \r\n    CREATE TABLE `casimir_stats` (\r\n      `short_url` varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',\r\n      `use_date` timestamp NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00'\r\n    ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nCopy `user/casimir-conf.php.example` to `user/casimir-conf.php` and edit the configuration settings.\r\n\r\nRename `htaccess` to `.htaccess` according to your settings.\r\n\r\n### Personalization\r\n\r\nOptionnaly, you can add\r\n- a `user/footer.php` script that will be added after Cas.im/ir's footer\r\n- a `user/screen.css` stylesheet that will be loaded after Cas.im/ir's one\r\n","tagline":"Yet Another URL Shortener","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
